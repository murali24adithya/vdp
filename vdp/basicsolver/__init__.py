# Package for a basic conjunctive solver
# The intention is to model other 'useful' solvers based on the structure of this one.

# The solver module contains the main class defining the solver call and special configuration options.
# The rep file contains a class that defines a 'representation' in SMT of a generic formula belonging
# to the hypothesis class of the solver. It also provides various functions to access that representation.
